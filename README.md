A web-based AI tool that generates PRONOM database entries from file format information. PRONOM is a database of file formats maintained by The National Archives that helps with digital preservation efforts.

## Features

- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Generation**: Uses artificial intelligence to analyze file information and generate structured PRONOM database entries
- **ðŸ”— Multiple AI Providers**: Supports OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and local AI implementations
- **ðŸŽ¨ User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern web interface for easy data input and output
- **ðŸ“¤ Export Functionality**: Copy generated entries to clipboard or export as text files
- **ðŸ“š Example Data**: Includes sample PRONOM entries to guide users

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

1. **Run the local server**:
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```
   
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Using the Tool

1. **Input File Information**:
